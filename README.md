# Portfolio Website

A clean, modern portfolio website built with HTML and Tailwind CSS.

## Setup

1. Clone this repository
2. Replace `profile.jpg` with your own profile picture
3. Update the following in `index.html`:
   - Your name and title
   - Your bio/description
   - Your social media links (GitHub, LinkedIn, email)
   - Your resume link

## Customization

The website uses Tailwind CSS for styling. The main accent color (`accent-green`) can be modified in the Tailwind configuration in `index.html`.

## Development

To view the website locally, simply open `index.html` in your web browser. No build step is required since we're using Tailwind CSS via CDN.
